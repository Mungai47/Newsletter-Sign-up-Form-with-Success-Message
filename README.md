## What I Learned

While working on this project, I gained insights into:

- Implementing a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Using CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout structuring.
- Validating form input using JavaScript and displaying appropriate messages.
- Enhancing user experience with hover and focus states.
- Creating a simple, clean UI for form interaction and success messaging.

Here's an example of validating email format in JavaScript:

```js
function validateEmail(email) {
    const emailPattern = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
    return emailPattern.test(email);
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to focus on:

- Improving accessibility and ensuring the site is usable for everyone.
- Exploring more advanced CSS techniques and animations.
- Integrating backend functionality for real form submissions.
- Learning more about JavaScript frameworks to streamline development.
